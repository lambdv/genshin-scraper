This can trigger once every 0.1s.\nAfter using this, Mavuika gains 10 Nightsoul points and enters the Nightsoul's Blessing state. Riding her Flamestrider high in the air, she uses a powerful Sunfell Slice against opponents on the ground, dealing Nightsoul-aligned  and entering the \"Crucible of Death and Life\" state.\n**Crucible of Death and Life**\nDuring this time, Mavuika's various actions will no longer consume Nightsoul points, and her interruption resistance is increased. Also, the DMG dealt by Sunfell Slice and \"Ancient Name Unbound\"'s Normal and Charged Attacks is increased based on the amount of Fighting Spirit she has when using the Elemental Burst.\nCrucible of Death and Life will be canceled when Mavuika leaves the field.",
