While this state is active, the Wanderer's movements gain the following properties:- Persistently consumes Kuugoryoku Points to maintain this hovering state.\n- When sprinting, additional Kuugoryoku Points will be consumed for the Wanderer to accelerate mid-air. Holding sprint will cause persistent Kuugoryoku Point consumption to maintain speed. This effect will replace his default sprint.\n- Jumping expends extra Kuugoryoku Points to increase hovering height. Holding jump will cause persistent Kuugoryoku Point consumption to keep increasing hovering height.\nRunning out of Kuugoryoku Points will end the Windfavored state.\nA second cast during the duration of Windfavored will also end it.",
